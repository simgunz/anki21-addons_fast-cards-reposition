This add-on allows to reposition new cards (changing the due field) in a fast way from the browser view (without using the reposition tool).

To use this add on, <b>sort the cards</b> in the browser by <b>due date</b>. At this point three new actions appear in the <i>Cards</i> menu and can be used to move cards up, down and to top.

Multiple cards can be moved together.

Using the shortcuts ALT+Up/Down/0 repositioning is even faster.
